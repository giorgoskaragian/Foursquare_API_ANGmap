# Foursquare_API_ANGmap

This is an application made for Omnixell summer internship application.

It is designed for Android devices.

In the course of making this i have managed to learn the following things:

-How to work the nav stack,pushing with or without arguments

-How to present/dismiss modals

-How to get data from public APIs

-What angular templates(*ngFor, *ngIf e.g) and {{}} are and how to use them.

-I am also aware of the flex properties they have but i chose to spend
my time on the above.(I already know how flexbox works)

-I also saw the sass variables on the docs but i didn't need them?

-More stuff that i cannot remember/am aware right now.

Main Problems
(From my understanding there are only "patches" that work for these)

-I could not make the Ionic native map work in a modal.

-I could not make the keyboard stay afloat the background image,
so it doesnt push/resize it.

But most important of all i understand now that i can make an app from scratch 
with what i already know(of course stackoverflow/ionic-forums/youtube are always helpful).

!!Notice!!
This was designed for Android Mobile Devices, so you will notice things 
if you make the view size bigger.
(There are also some css rules specific for IOS so it appears the same
way for the most part-if you want to run it on IOS).
